# Tutorial

The purpose of this game is to survive as long as possible by avoiding and destroying asteroids.

Here are the controls :
- **Left Arrow (`←`)**: Rotate the ship left.
- **Right Arrow (`→`)**: Rotate the ship right.
- **Up Arrow (`↑`)**: Accelerate the ship.
- **Space**: Fire a projectile.

The speed and number of asteroids gradually increase as the game progresses.

Your score, displayed in the top-left corner, increases by 1000 points each time you destroy an asteroid.

Good luck !
